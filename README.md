# About

I just did a course about **PySpark** and this notebook is my first attempt at working with it and learn how it can be used for EDA and **machine learning**.<br><br>

PySpark is an interface for **Apache Spark in Python** that allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs and is helpful for working with real-time and large-scale data.<br><br>

# The Titanic Machine Learning Competetion

This project is based on the Titanic dataset provided on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/description">Titanic ML challenge on Kaggle</a>. Its task is to build a machine learning model that can tell us if passengers were more likely to survive or not according to their data, such as socio-economic class, age, and gender.<br><br>

The evaluation method for this model will be the accuracy score i.e the total percentage of correctly predicted passengers.<br><br>

This is a binary classification problem and the classes used for predications are 1 for survived and 0 for deceased.<br><br>

I used PySpark for an exploratory data analysis, data cleansing and to build logistic regression, random forest classifier and GBTClassifier models.<br><br>
